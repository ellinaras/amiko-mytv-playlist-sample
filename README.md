# amiko-mytv-playlist-sample
This playlist is a just a sample playlist which can be used on Amiko IPTV players via MYTV app playlist option.
Unfortunatelly the EPG cannot be parsed via the .m3u when MYTV is used with playlist option and need to be entered in a epg URL field.
As EPG source for the sample playlist provided here you can use this: https://iptv-org.github.io/epg/guides/gr.xml
